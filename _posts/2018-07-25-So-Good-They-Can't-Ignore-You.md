So I finally managed to read a book this weekend, yay! Now I need to keep this streak going.

["So Good They Can't Ignore You" by Cal Newport][1] was so good I couldn't ignore it (it's a bad pun. I know!). Honestly it was liberating and insightful.

At first I thought of writing a summary, but the more I thought about it, more discomforting it became. 'Cause a. I think I'm not smart enough to summarize a person's years of work in a mere few sentences, and b. It just doesn't make sense to me (to write a summary). So, what I'll do instead is to write what I learned by reading this book. So kinda like a book review. Lol.

### Internet and a constant struggle to keep your views immaculate

Before I get into the book review, there's something that I need to say it. So, I was trying to write this review and I just so happen to look at goodreads' book reviews for the book at hand, just to get the general idea. Now, you should note that I didn't read the reviews before. And, Now I'm reading all these reviews and they are changing the way I look at the book. Before I went online, I was very clear on how I felt about the book. But, after reading some of the reviews, I was unsure about how I felt. I doubted my views about the book. That got me to thinking, how easily I am allowing some stranger from the internet to pollute my views about a particular thing. And, it's not just about the book reviews, everywhere I look, I'm constantly bombarded with different views from different people around the internet, be it reddit, twitter, instagram or insert-your-favorite-social-media-platform. Now, generally considering other peoples views is a good thing, It gives you different angle to look at. But, this was different. I was influenced by their views (in a insidious sort of way). So, I'll need to dig a little deeper into why this happens and how can I thwart it while also taking in the good views (need to define what is considered as a good view as I feel like it is very subjective tbh). So, I'll get back to you on that, next week.

### Now, the review time.

Ok, so for the longest of time, I'd been looking for this dream job, the calling, Something that I would be passionate about, something I'd love to every day of my life. This book came in on me like, "yeah, that's not gonna happen.". It dosed me with a red pill to be honest. And, I can never go back now. So, here's what I learnt from the book,

- That “follow your passion” is bad advice, as the vast majority of people don’t have pre-existing passions waiting to be discovered and matched to a job. *ouch!*
- People with compelling careers instead start by getting good at something rare and valuable—building what he calls “career capital”—and then cashing in this capital for the traits that make great work great.
- What are those traits that make great work great you might ask?
  - Creativity
  - Impact
  - Control

- So, how does one get good at something?
Well, naturally by deliberate practice. Now this is what we all know but don't do. This is what every successful person on this planet does. There's no shortcut here. You need to practice to get good at it. Practice hard folks!

>“All of us who do creative work … you get into this thing, and there’s like a ‘gap.’ What you’re making isn’t so good, okay? … It’s trying to be good but … it’s just not that great,” he explained in an interview about his career. “The key thing is to force yourself through the work, force the skills to come; that’s the hardest phase,” - Ira Glass

Now, I can write about how to motivate oneself all day long and at the end of the day, it won't make much of difference (I'll write about it in another article as to why is such the case. But for now, understand that motivating oneself is hard. It takes lot of energy). But, what I can say that'll work every damn time is to just do it. It's Simple as that. Set aside your goals for a day and No matter the consequences, your emotions, your situation, **just do it!**
