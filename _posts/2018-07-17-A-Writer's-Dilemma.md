*It is Saturday morning and you've bunch of cool topics pre-selected from your long list of topics that you want to write about. You're excited. You've been thinking about writing about this topic the whole week and finally you get down to it. But, you can't glue together the words to form an elegant sentence. So, you write one, only to delete it the next second. It's been few hours now and you're really frustrated with your work. You decide to just leave it for now. Rinse, Repeat the next week.*

So, now you know why there haven't been much posts lately. I don't post because I feel like my writing isn't perfect. And my writing won't reach that level of perfectionism if I don't write more often. So I need  to break out of this loop. One way I can think of is to just keep writing regardless of how bad/stupid it might look or judging it. Becuase, you know what, It is just fine. It don't matter. I don't need to be perfect. 

So, starting this week I'll start posting (*again*) every week, No matter the size, quality or stupidty of the post. And I'm hoping to improve my writing over time with this approach. Let's see how it pans out. *fingers crossed.*

P.S. I almost didn't post this because I thought this was stupid. Although, it is still stupid, but I've realized, I don't care.
