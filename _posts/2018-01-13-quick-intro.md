### Hi, I’m Akash.  I’m a software developer. 

I’ve been trying to write for a long time now. But, I’ve a hard time maintaining it. Over the course I’ve realised that the reason for my failure is a. I keep looking for the perfect topic to write about, b. I want every detail to be perfect, c. I procrastinate, procrastinate and procrastinate. I definitely needed a plan.

So, I decided to make a commitment to publish a post at the end of every week and write about what I learned in that week rather than about a particular topic. This would allow me to a. reflect on my week, and b. free me of coming up with topic to write about (which btw I couldn’t), and c. will motivate me (I hope!) to follow through. We’ll have to see. And, I hope my posts are interesting and helpful to you as reader.

See you in a week!
