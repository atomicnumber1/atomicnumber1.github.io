So, as promised I’ll reflect back on my last week with this posts. This week, I decided to go back to basics. I needed a fresh start.

### Learning How to Learn
I’ve touched on many fields of interest in the past and I’ve never been able to follow through with any of it. I always give up half way through with bunch of excuses that, frankly, even surprise me. And, I’ve been eyeing this course, [**learning how to learn by Dr. Barbara Oakley, Dr Terrence Sejnowski and Linda Walker**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/) for a year now. So, this week I decided to jump right in. And surprisingly, I managed to complete week 1 of the course. I purchased the course soon after so as to motivate me to complete it and not give up.

In the first week, Barbara briefly explains how our brain learns/think. Basically there are two modes of thinking, **a. Focused mode** and, **b. Diffused mode**, and you alternate between this modes of thinking. You can only be in one mode at any particular point in time. Barbara then explains how we form most of our neural connections in diffused mode. If we take the analogy of a light of car, focused mode is like a high beam light (highly concentrated at one particular region) and diffuse mode is like a low beam light (more spread out). She also shows how notable people used this knowledge to accomplish their goals. She then explains the importance of sleep in learning. In fact it’s one of the vital part of our living being. Basically Sleeping is when our brain washes out the toxins it has accumulated over the time you’ve been awake. It’s also when our brain forms this neural connections to what you’ve just learned. She also touches on memory, procrastination and some of the methods we can use to overcome it. And finally there are bunch of interviews from different people (accomplished people) focusing on what techniques they used to achieve their goals and how we can used them too. I’m definitely looking forward to week 2. And, I recommend everyone who is reading this to take this course. It’s really informative, motivating and fun.

### Introduction to Grammar
I never paid attention to literature subjects in my high school (We had god dammed 4 language subjects. Basically Sanskrit, Hindi, Gujarati and English). It’s not that I didn’t like language subjects, In fact I loved them. I just didn’t like the idea of studying for the test. And, because I was a stupid high school kid. And so, even though I can read, speak and write fairly decent English sentences which are grammatically correct, I often lack the understanding of the underlying parts of speech which makes a sentence. So, I figured why not brush up on that too.

And so, I started (btw every time you see started, read as restarted. Because as I mentioned previously, I have a tendency to give up subjects) [**Introduction to Grammar on Khan Academy by David Rheinstrom**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/). Which is surprisingly good. David is really a great teacher. I’d already learned Nouns, Verbs and Pronouns previously, so this week I learned Adjectives and Adverbs.  Now, I could write about each and every one of these part of speech in here, but that’d be boring. So, If you think that you may need to brush up on Grammar, do me a favour and just watch this series. It’s clear, concise and in way fun (Now that’s a sentence I never thought I’d say about Grammar, but it’s true).

***Fun fact**: The course is divided into sections and their’s a test at the end of each section (unit test) to check your understanding of the subject of the section. Khan Academy has this feature where if you are applying the course for the first time, they’ll take the unit test from each section and recommend you, from which section you should start learning. And, I passed each and every unit test. So according to Khan academy and unit tests, I’d a very good understanding of grammar and I didn’t need to take the course. And yet, I still didn’t understand the underlying concepts of parts of speech. Like what makes a pronoun pronoun, which article is appropriate where, compound prepositions, prepositional phrases, etc. This really surprised me, How much grammar you can learn from just speaking, reading and listening. **Conclusion:** If your gut says the sentence is grammatically correct, it’s definitely correct. Trust your instincts, even though you may not know why and the underlying parts of the speech.*

### Learning iOS Development from Ray Wenderlich
Ok, so this something new I’ve been experimenting with. I had purchased [**iOS 11 and Swift 4 for Beginners by Ray Wenderlich on Udemy**](https://www.udemy.com/ios-and-swift-for-beginners-200-hands-on-tutorials/) for $10 on sale (frankly, Udemy always has some kind of sale). I’d started on this course a month ago, completed few sections and as you may have guessed, forgot about it. But, after completing the first week of learning how to learn, I was motivated enough to restart it. And So I did. This week I reflected back on my previous sections and I plan to follow through with it this time around (wish me luck!). And I do like it. It takes a very hands on approach compared to a typical lecture oriented approach. Now I’m not saying one is better over other. I guess, it depends on person to person. If you like a more class like approach Stanford’s CS193P iOS  11 Swift 4 is an excellent choice. This week I just brushed up on Swift 4 constructs like closures, classes, structs, protocols, properties, etc


I hope this has been informative for you.

See you next week!

P.S. I was really skeptical if I’ll ever be able to write this post. Thank God I made it this week!
